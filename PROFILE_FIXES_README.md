# Profile Functionality Fixes

I've identified and fixed the issues with the profile settings page. Here's what was wrong and how I fixed it:

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Non-functional Save Button**
- **Problem**: The save button was purely cosmetic with no onClick handler
- **Fix**: Added complete save functionality with state management, API calls, and error handling

### 2. **No Profile Picture Upload**
- **Problem**: Upload button had no functionality  
- **Fix**: Added complete image upload system with:
  - File validation (type and size checks)
  - Image preview before upload
  - Supabase Storage integration
  - Proper error handling

### 3. **Missing Profile Data Loading**
- **Problem**: Form fields were empty because no data was being fetched
- **Fix**: Added profile data fetching from database on component load

### 4. **No Profile Creation After Signup**
- **Problem**: User details weren't being saved during registration
- **Fix**: Enhanced signup process to:
  - Create complete user profiles automatically
  - Set up default user settings
  - Ensure profile data persists after signup

### 5. **Missing Database Schema**
- **Problem**: No storage buckets for file uploads and incomplete user settings table
- **Fix**: Added complete database schema with storage buckets and policies

## Files Modified

1. **`src/pages/user/UserProfile.tsx`** - Complete rewrite with:
   - React hooks for state management
   - Form handling and validation
   - Profile data fetching and saving
   - Image upload functionality
   - Loading and error states

2. **`src/components/auth/AuthForm.tsx`** - Enhanced signup process:
   - Better user profile creation
   - Default settings setup
   - Error handling and fallbacks

3. **`database_setup.sql`** - Added:
   - Storage buckets for avatars, property images, and documents
   - Storage policies for secure file access
   - Complete database schema

## How to Test

### 1. Database Setup
First, update your database with the new schema:

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste the entire contents of `database_setup.sql`
3. Run the query to create all tables, triggers, and storage buckets

### 2. Test User Signup
1. Go to the user signup page (`/user-signup`)
2. Fill in all fields (first name, last name, email, phone, password)
3. Submit the form
4. Check that you're automatically logged in and redirected to dashboard

### 3. Test Profile Settings
1. Navigate to User Dashboard → Profile Settings
2. You should see the form populated with your signup data
3. Try editing any field (name, phone, bio, etc.)
4. Upload a profile picture (supports JPG, PNG, WebP, GIF up to 5MB)
5. Click "Save Changes"
6. Verify you see success message and changes are saved
7. Refresh the page to confirm data persists

### 4. Test Profile Picture Upload
1. Click "Upload Photo" in the Profile Photo section
2. Select an image file from your computer
3. You should see a preview of the selected image
